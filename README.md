# hello-world

First repository; created as part of the 'Hello World' guide for github.

Hello world! I am a Physics major and have programming as a hobby. I have very little formal training in programming. The only formal training I have had is in C and C++ (we barely touched OOP). So far I have learned HTML, PHP, Java, Python, Fortran (a little, didn't like the syntax very much..). And by learned I mean mostly the basics, almost any of you could optimize my programs a lot (if you are reading this on github, you are most probably an experienced programmer/developer :D).
